In this respository I will include practical examples for estimating animal density using the vertical Random Encounter Model (vREM) in our manuscript entitled "A Random Encounter Model for density estimation 
with vertically oriented camera traps". R files and their related datasets are provided. 

The codes part includes detection zone estimation (profile) and vREM estimation. Related data applied in the codes can be found in the data folder. The original data cannot be shared for the conservation of endangered species. The estimations of parameters including speed and activity level are not provided but can be found from former studies (Rowcliffe et al., 2014 & Rowcliffe et al., 2016). Feel free to give suggestions if you are interested!
